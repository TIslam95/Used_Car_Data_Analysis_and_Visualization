In this analyses, the original dataset has been divided into 7 different datasets each containing the data for one individual brand of cars mentioned above. Similar analysis and visialization operations were then performed on these individual datasets. Each of the EDA resulted in a total of 9 barplots representing diffdrent EDA results on the individual brand of cars.
